            <br>My motivation for this study and my study choice is that i like computers and i have always been very
            curious how they work.
            <br>I have a friend in the second year of this study who showed me some exercises from when he was in his
            first year.
            <br>and i thought it was really fun and interesting to learn and see how it works.
            <br>So my main motivation was my interest in computers and the pre view i got from my friend last year of
            this program

            <br>My strenghts are that if i want something done i want it to be good and i wont stop until im happy with
            the result.
            <br>This can also be a weakness because i can get lost in it sometimes, in a way that i try to get it too
            perfect wich is not good
            <br>opportunities for me in this program is to learn alot ofcourse, but also make new friends and open a new
            chapter in my life
            <br>My threats are that i can get distracted sometimes. This is not always a bad thing, most of the time its
            an indicator that i need a break
            <br>but if it happens too often it can become a threat.

            <br>My programming experience before this program was 0. i havent programmed before this in my life,
            <br>so it was hard for me in the beginning to understand the theory.
            <br>At the moment it has become easier and i have learned a lot already.
            <br>I think programming is mostly really fun, but it can be really annoying sometimes if i dont know what
            the bug is for example.
            <br>It was also very nice that my friend in the second year helped me mostly in the beginning with coding
            and stuff
            <br>wich really helped me with understanding theory and learning how to code

            <br>My first feedback was for PCO and it was really helpful for me,
            <br> mostly because i had no experience with programming
            <br>So it was nice to have other people look at my work and give me tips
            <br>Almost all the feedback was good and i implemented it in to my website
